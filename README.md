# Hi, we're Team Vulpine

We're a group of game developers trying to make game development and game modding more accessible.

This organization holds the repositories for our projects

We're currently working on a Voxel engine called Stratum Engine, with an accompanying game called Stratalia.

We're also working on an embeddable scripting language called [Burrow](https://github.com/TeamVulpine/Burrow).
